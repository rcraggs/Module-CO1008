# What you should learn today

- What are 'Software Requirements'?
- Where do they come from?
- What do we do with them?
- What happens if requirements are wrong or missing?

# What are software requirements?

# Challenge 1: Draw a face

^ see if they have any questions beforehand. Expect them to do it. cast some of them onto the screen.

# Did you draw the face I wanted?

# Requirements

## A clear, unambiguous, easy to understand description of something to be created

---

#Pencil Requirements

1. must make clear, dark marks when used
1. it must write on paper and cardboard
1. it does not have to work on a whiteboard
1. able to use it for 8 hours a day for one week and it still work.
1. must be possible to remove that mark using an eraser.
1. It *could* have an eraser on the end
1. It must be less than 20cm long

^ N.B some of these are true for all pencils, some are my preferences. Since it's my pencil I can choose what I like

#Example 2 
## Filing Cabinet

![fit](http://a.tgcdn.net/images/products/zoom/mini_businesscard_filecabinet.jpg)

^ write down some requirements for a filing calbinet

---

#Filing Cabinet Requirements 

1. It must have a secure lock on each drawer
1. It must have between 3 and 5 drawers
1. The drawers must be able to hold A4 paper
1. Each drawer must be easy to open for a normal person
1. Only 1 draw must be able to be open at a time
1. It must be on wheels*

*<sub>we'll come back to this later</sub> 

^ There are already some problems with these, like what is a "normal" person. How "secure" is "secure".

# Software Requirements = hard :scream:

^ Think how hard it is to define requirements for a filing cabinet

- What the system must do
- What is must look like
- How well it performs
- What hardware it runs on
- etc etc etc

but **most** software is built from a set of requirements

---

# How they are used

---

![fit](/Users/rc305/g/skitch-images/how_reqs_are_used.png)

---

## Developers/Designers

_are the main consumers of requirements_

- Interpret the requirements to **build** something that satisfies requirements
- Ask the analyst for clarification when something isn't clear
- Spot and raise problems with the requirements 

![right fit](/Users/rc305/g/skitch-images/how_reqs_are_used.png)

---

## Testers

- Check that the software matches the requirements 

![right fit](/Users/rc305/g/skitch-images/how_reqs_are_used.png)

---

## Business/Requirements Analysts

_the **expert** on what a system should do_

- Talk to users and stakeholders to **elicit** requirements
- Analysts use models and language to clearly describe the requirements and fix problems in them
- Answer question about the requirements (and find out more if necessary)


![right fit](/Users/rc305/g/skitch-images/how_reqs_are_used.png)

---

## A business analyst has to....

- ask the **right questions** to find out what users want and don't want
- Find out what what users **need** not what they say they want
- Be aware of how much a requirement will **cost**
- Think of all the things that users have **forgotten**.

# Result: Analyst are usually paid more than developers

# Requirements are documented as

**Written requirements:** _"users are shown the current date in their timezone in the format YYYY-MMM-DD"_

**Models:**

**Anything else that makes the requirements more clear**

# What happens when we get them wrong?

# Example
##Employment Tribunals Online

![right 70%](/Users/rc305/g/skitch-images/etfees.png)

^ Quick explanation of paper forms -> online system
^ Quick demo

> "The form must time-out after 20 minutes of inactivity. All data must be cleared from the form."
-- System Requirement

^ This is a perfectly reasonable requirement for security

# Angry users complain that they've lost 2 hours of work filling in the form

![](http://www.localsearchmasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/angry-dude.jpg)

---

# Outcome? ðŸ’¸

Much of Â£1,000,000 system will be rewritten to accommodate a new, missing requirement. 

*"Users must be able to save their progress so that they can complete, then submit their form data in the future"*

# Why software projects fail

![inline](/Users/rc305/g/skitch-images/co1008-project-fails.png)

*Source: The Standish Group: The CHAOS Report, 1994*

^ n.b that is not why projects a % of failed projects failed but % of projects that reported that problem,
^ there is a lot of focus on tools, technologies, methodologies, but the majority of problems are with requirements

# Why is this **_so_** hard?

1. Most users don't have a clear idea of what they want
2. The analyst needs to be an expert in the domain.
3. It must work in an labs/office/factory with many IT/Legal constraints. 
4. Unrealistic expectations.
5. **"Unknown Unknowns"** - things we don't know we've missed
6. People want to "just get on with doing it".

# Assessment

- in groups
- write a **complete** set of requirements for a **real** project
- use any techniques we teach you in CO1008
- you'll be grades on: could these reqs be used to create an actual system
- Prizes for the best
