# What you should learn today

- What are 'Requirements'?
- Where do they come from?
- What do we do with them?
- What happens if requirements are wrong or missing?

# Challenge 1: Draw a face

^ see if they have any questions beforehand. Expect them to do it. cast some of them onto the screen.

# Did you draw the face I wanted?

# Requirements

## A clear, unambiguous, easy to understand description of something to be created

---

#Pencil Requirements

1. must make clear, dark marks when used
1. it must write on paper and cardboard
1. it does not have to work on a whiteboard
1. able to use it for 8 hours a day for one week and it still work.
1. must be possible to remove that mark using an eraser.
1. It *could* have an eraser on the end
1. It must be less than 20cm long

^ N.B some of these are true for all pencils, some are my preferences. Since it's my pencil I can choose what I like

#Example 2 
## Filing Cabinet

![fit](http://a.tgcdn.net/images/products/zoom/mini_businesscard_filecabinet.jpg)

^ write down some requirements for a filing calbinet

---

#Filing Cabinet Requirements 

1. It must have a secure lock on each drawer
1. It must have between 3 and 5 drawers
1. The drawers must be able to hold A4 paper
1. Each drawer must be easy to open for a normal person
1. Only 1 draw must be able to be open at a time
1. It must be on wheels*

*<sub>we'll come back to this later</sub> 

^ There are already some problems with these, like what is a "normal" person. How "secure" is "secure".

# Software Requirements = hard :scream:

^ Think how hard it is to define requirements for a filing cabinet

**Software is:**

- Big
- Flexible
- Invisible

but **most** software is built from a set of requirements

---

# Most software written today...

1. written for a few users for a very specific task.
2. to fit into an existing (old) process with many rules and unusual terminology.
3. It's taken users years to learn these rules and terminology.
4. It must work in an office/factory with many IT constraints. 
5. You have to tell programmers almost *exactly* what to write.

^ if the software solves a common, obvious problem then someone has already written it. 
^ however most users think their work is "obvious"

# Example

^ Quick explanation of paper forms -> online system
^ Quick demo

> "The form must time-out after 20 minutes of inactivity. All data must be cleared from the form."
-- System Requirement

^ This is a perfectly reasonable requirement for security

# Angry users complain that they've lost 2 hours of work filling in the form

---

# Outcome? ðŸ’¸

Much of Â£1,000,000 system will be rewritten to accommodate a new, missing requirement. 

*"Users must be able to save their progress so that they can complete, then submit their form data in the future"*

# Why software projects fail

![inline](/Users/rc305/g/skitch-images/co1008-project-fails.png)

*Source: The Standish Group: The CHAOS Report, 1994*

^ n.b that is not why projects a % of failed projects failed but % of projects that reported that problem,
^ there is a lot of focus on tools, technologies, methodologies, but the majority of problems are with requirements
